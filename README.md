# Life Expectancy Predictor App (Flutter APP)

A Flutter-based mobile application that estimates a user's **life expectancy** based on key lifestyle and demographic inputs. 
The app provides an intuitive user interface and calculates predicted lifespan using basic heuristics in a user-friendly format.

## 🚀 Features

* Clean and modern UI
* User inputs include:

  * Gender
  * Height & Weight
  * Smoking frequency
  * Exercise habits
  * Daily water intake
* Real-time slider controls for dynamic input
* Instant calculation of predicted lifespan
* Modular and scalable architecture

## 📱 Screens

### 1. `InputPage`

Collects all necessary data from the user via `Slider`, `Row`, `Column`, and custom UI widgets.

### 2. `ResultPage`

Displays the final calculated life expectancy in a clean layout. Includes a back button to re-enter inputs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
* **UI:** Material Design components
* **Architecture:** Stateless & StatefulWidgets

## 📂 Project Structure

```
lib/
├── main.dart          # Entry point of the app
├── input_page.dart    # Input screen with all user controls
└── result_page.dart   # Result screen showing life expectancy
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User provides inputs using sliders and selectors.
2. App calculates a life expectancy value based on input weightings.
3. Result screen displays estimated life span in years.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Integrate a real health-based API or dataset for more accurate predictions.
* Add visual charts or animations for better UX.
* Support for saving user history.

## 📦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK installed
* Emulator or physical device

### Run the App

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## 🧠 Inspiration

Inspired by wellness and health tracking tools, the app gamifies the idea of longevity awareness and personal habits.
